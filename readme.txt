Create custom dynamic sidebars and use anywhere with shortcodes.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a button to widgets area to create a new sidebar area which you can later use just about anywhere.

To display the sidebar with shortcode you can use ``[stag_sidebar id="1"]`` where ``id`` is the id of the sidebar that appears in the description area of the respective widget area. You can also pass an additional parameter ``class`` in shortcode to add class to the widget area wrapper on frontend.
